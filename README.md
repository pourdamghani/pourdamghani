## About me 

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/inet-tuberlin/">INET</a> research group at the Technical University of Berlin, Germany, working under the supervision of <a href="https://schmiste.github.io/">Prof. Stefan Schmid</a>. I am also an associated researcher with <a href="https://plamadiso.weizenbaum-institut.de">PLAMADISO</a>
research group at the <a href="https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/en">Weizenbaum Institute</a> for the Networked Society.

Previously I was a researcher at the University of Vienna and completed research internships at IST Austria and CUHK Hong Kong. I got my B.Sc. from the Sharif University of Technology.

I am interested in algorithm design and analysis with applications in networks, distributed systems, and blockchains. My particular focus is on [self-adjusting networks](https://self-adjusting.net/).
